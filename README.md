### Binary search
This has to be sorted first and is fast O(log n)

### Selection sort
Selection sort is a neat algorithm but it's not very fast. It takes O(n x n) time. Quicksort is faster

### Recursion
* Recursion is when a function calls itself.
* Every recursive function has two cases: the base case and the recursive case.
* A stack has two operations push and pop.
* All function calls go onto the call stack.
* The call stack can get very large, which takes up a lot of memory.
